"""Prompt to a batch run, using the shared seed sources.

This sits beside the existing `/api/discovery` workflow rather than replacing
it. That one searches with SearXNG and judges pages with a local model, which
is the right tool when nothing authoritative exists. This one asks a register
first and search second, and hands the result to the batch path that has
already been proven on 78 hospitals.

The portal already crawls a list of hospitals well, and already resumes a batch
across a restart. What it lacked was a way to produce that list without a
person assembling the spreadsheet by hand. That work lives in the shared
`seedsources` package.

Seeds become a CSV in the portal's own upload template and go through the
existing batch path, so history, resume, pause and the Excel export all behave
exactly as they do for a file a person uploaded. Nothing in the crawl changes.

    POST /api/seeds/preview   what would be crawled, and where each URL came from
    POST /api/seeds/run       the same, then start the normal batch
