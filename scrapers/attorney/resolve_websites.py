"""Website resolver: fills the registry's blank website column.

The registry gives a statutory name but no URL. This finds the institution's
own site by searching for the name, then scoring candidate domains. Scoring is
the whole point: a search for an Indian college returns aggregator pages long
before it returns the college, so a resolver that takes the first result is
worse than no resolver.

A candidate is accepted only when the domain itself carries enough of the
institution's name. Nothing is written on a weak match; the row stays blank and
is reported, because a wrong website silently poisons every later crawl.

The search function is injected, so the same scoring serves ddgs, SearXNG or
anything else, and so it can be tested without a network.

CLI:
  python resolve_websites.py --db results/registry.db --district Pune --limit 25
  python resolve_websites.py --db results/registry.db --district Pune --dry-run
  python resolve_websites.py --self-test
